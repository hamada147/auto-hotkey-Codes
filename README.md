# auto-hotkey-Mount-Blade
auto hotkey program codes for a couple of things that I use daily

in order to run any of these codes you need to install the following program autohotkey from [auto hotkey](https://autohotkey.com/)

#1 Mount & Blade (will work on any version of the game)
you can use the short cuts only when you have the game as an active window

ctrl + H: will keep restoring your health automaticauly durring the whole battle
just don't forget to press it again in order to stop the effect

ctrl + F: you can use it in three diffenet menus of the game
1. the charachter menu: will add 100*1000 ex to the player in a matter of less than one seconds
2. the inventory menu: will add 100*1000 denar to the player in a matter of less than one seconds
3. the party menu: once selected a troop with a potinatioal upgrade, it will automatically keep adding experiance to that troop until it become upgradable
